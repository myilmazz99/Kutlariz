Kutlariz is a web app built with ASP.Net Core 3.1 for learning and practicing.

It lets you list birthdays and track how far the next birthday is.
It also houses a sandbox version of a Payment API provided by Iyzico, that helps simulate a successful payment by ordering a cake for an upcoming birthday.

Below is a list of test credit card numbers that you can use for a successful payment:

- 5890040000000016
